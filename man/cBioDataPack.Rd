\title{Obtain pre-packaged data from cBioPortal and represent as
a MultiAssayExperiment object}
\usage{
cBioDataPack(
  cancer_study_id,
  use_cache = TRUE,
  names.field = c("Hugo_Symbol", "Entrez_Gene_Id", "Gene"),
  cleanup = TRUE,
  ask = interactive(),
  check_build = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cancer_study_id}{character(1) The study identifier from cBioPortal as
seen in the dataset links at \url{https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets}}

\item{use_cache}{logical(1) (default TRUE) create the default cache location
and use it to track downloaded data. If data found in the cache, data will
not be re-downloaded. A path can also be provided to data cache location.}

\item{names.field}{character() Possible column names for the
column that will used to label ranges for data such as mutations or copy
number (default:
\code{c("Hugo_Symbol", "Entrez_Gene_Id", "Gene", "Composite.Element.REF")}).
Values are cycled through and eliminated when no data present, or duplicates
are found. Values in the corresponding column must be unique in each row.}

\item{cleanup}{logical(1) whether to delete the \code{untar}-red contents from
the \code{exdir} folder (default TRUE)}

\item{ask}{logical(1) Whether to prompt the the user before downloading and
loading study \code{MultiAssayExperiment} that is not currently building based
on previous testing. Set to \code{interactive()} by default. In a
non-interactive session, data download will be attempted; equivalent to
\code{ask = FALSE}. The argument will also be used when a cache directory needs
to be created when using \code{downloadStudy}.}

\item{check_build}{logical(1L) Whether to check the build status of the
\code{studyId} using an internal dataset. This argument should be set to
\code{FALSE} if using alternative \code{hostnames}, e.g.,
'pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org'}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{MultiAssayExperiment} object
}
\description{
The \code{cBioDataPack} function allows the user to
download and process cancer study datasets found in MSKCC's cBioPortal.
Output datasets use the \linkS4class{MultiAssayExperiment} data
representation to faciliate analysis and data management operations.
}
\details{
The full list of study identifiers (\code{studyId}s) can obtained from
\code{getStudies()}. Currently, only ~ 72\% of datasets can be represented as
\code{MultiAssayExperiment} data objects from the data tarballs. Refer to
\code{getStudies(..., buildReport = TRUE)} and its \code{"pack_build"} column to see
which study identifiers are not building. Users who would like to prioritize
particular datasets should open GitHub issues at the URL in the
\code{DESCRIPTION} file. For a more fine-grained approach to downloading data
from the cBioPortal API, refer to the \code{cBioPortalData} function.
}
\section{cBio_URL}{

The \code{cBioDataPack} function accesses data from the \code{cBio_URL} option.
By default, it points to an Amazon S3 bucket location. Previously, it
pointed to 'http://download.cbioportal.org'. This recent change
(> 2.1.17) should provide faster and more reliable downloads for all users.
See the URL using \code{cBioPortalData:::.url_location}. This can be changed
if there are mirrors that host this data by setting the \code{cBio_URL} option
with \code{getOption("cBio_URL", "https://some.url.com/")} before running the
function.
